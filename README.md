# ENTRY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Given the visitors that we have in office and outside, there is a need to for an entry management software.

## PRODUCT OVERVIEW

Entry management system software can be used to track the number of visitors and keeping a record of the usage and the purpose of their visit in a simple and hassle free way.

Advantages of the product

-   Increased Security as it can track the visitor's stay period.
-   A less time consuming and hassle free entry management system

# FUTURE SCOPE

1. The Form can be accessed through a QR code present with the security guard.

2. The form can be further extended to two pages where the people who have already visited before can click the corresponding option while checking in and they don't need to fill the full form and can get their OTP by just entering their phone number. This can be helpful in avoiding storage of duplicate enteries in the database.
